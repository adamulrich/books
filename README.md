# Books
This project was the final for BYU-I WDD430 (Full Stack Web Dev). The requirements were to build an Mongo Express Angular Node.js (MEAN) SPA with at least 1 angular component. I built a simple book database that has an authors model as well, and provides linking between authors and books. It provides full crud support for both. It uses express routing.

## Components
Mongo
Mongoose
Node.js
Node.js Express
Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
